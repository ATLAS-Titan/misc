## Experiments MD workload

We execute a varying number of the same compute unit (CU) on a varying number of cores measuring strong and weak scalability as defined in [Ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.00678.pdf). We execute two experiments with:

1. Strong Scaling: 512 tasks executed using between 128 and 512 cores
2. Weak Scaling: Betwen 128 and 512 tasks executed on between 16 and 1024 cores, so as to keep ratio of number of tasks to cores constant (=1).

In both experiments we record the time to completion (TTC) of the execution as a measure of strong and weak scalability.
