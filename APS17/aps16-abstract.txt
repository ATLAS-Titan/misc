Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in range of
disciplines ranging from Material Science to Biophysical systems and account
for a large fraction of cycles consumed on campus, national and leadership
class machines. Increasingly science and engineering problems require the
successful execution of "many" MD simulations as opposed to a single long
running MD simulation. Independent of whether the computational problem is
formulated a workload comprised of an "ensemble" of identical simulations, or
as "complex workflows", there is a need to provide scalable and flexible
approaches to the execution of the workload. We present preliminary results
that demonstrate a general capability to manage workload execution agnostic of
specific MD simulation kernel or execution pattern. Our results build upon our
extensive experience of distributed workload management in the high-energy
physics ATLAS project using PanDA, coupled with recent conceptual  advances in
our understanding of workload management on heterogeneous resources. We will
discuss how we will generalize these initial capabilities towards a more
production level service on DOE leadership resources.
